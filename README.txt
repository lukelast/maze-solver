Building the project can be accomplished with apache ant or an IDE like eclipse or netbeans.
The recommended method is with an IDE.

With Eclipse or Netbeans just open the project form the included project files and do a build and then run.
The main file is in the maze.Main.java class.

With apache ant:
An ant build file is in the root directory called build.xml.
Just running the command “ant” from the command line in the directory with the build.xml file will compile the project into a “build” directory.
Then executing the command “ant run” will launch the project.

To build a jar file right click on the buildJar.xml file from within Eclipse and run it as an “ant build”.
